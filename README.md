## Recent Major Improvements ‚ú®

### Enhanced Places Recommendation System

The places recommendation system has been completely overhauled to provide **significantly better attraction finding** and **automatic image downloads**:

#### What Was Fixed
- **‚ùå Before**: Used basic OpenStreetMap with dummy data (all attractions rated 4.0)
- **‚úÖ Now**: Multi-source data aggregation with real ratings and rich information

#### New Features
1. **Multi-Source Data Integration**
   - Foursquare API for high-quality business data
   - OpenTripMap for Wikipedia-backed attractions
   - Enhanced OpenStreetMap with better categorization
   - Smart deduplication across sources

2. **Automatic Image Search & Download**
   - DuckDuckGo image search (no API key required)
   - Unsplash integration for high-quality travel photos
   - Automatic image assignment to attractions

3. **Improved Data Quality**
   - Real ratings from multiple sources
   - Rich descriptions from Wikipedia and Foursquare
   - Better categorization and filtering
   - Intelligent ranking based on data source quality

4. **Robust Fallback System**
   - Works without API keys using free sources
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
   - Always provides results even with network issues

### API Keys Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For best results, add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for LLM features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Optional but recommended for better attraction data
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY=your-foursquare-key
OPENTRIPMAP_API_KEY=your-opentripmap-key
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-unsplash-key
```

See `ENHANCED_PLACES_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.
